   BAMBOO 5.8.1 - README
Thank you for downloading Bamboo 5.8.1 - Standalone distribution. This distribution comes with a built-in Tomcat 7.0.40 web server and hsql database, so it runs (almost) out the box.
Installing Bamboo
    1.  Install a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.6 or above from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.
    2.  Set the JAVA_HOME variable to where you installed Java.
    3.  Set your Bamboo home directory. Instructions how to set your Bamboo Home directory can be found here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Installing+and+upgrading+Bamboo
    4.  Run bin/start-bamboo.sh (*nix) or bin\start-bamboo.bat (Windows). Check that there are no errors on the console. See below for troubleshooting advice.
    5.  Point your browser at http://localhost:8085. You should see Bamboo's Setup Wizard.
Full documentation is available online at:â€¨https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Installing+and+upgrading+Bamboo
Problems
A common startup problem is when another program has claimed port 8085, which Bamboo is configured to run on by default. To avoid this port conflict, Bamboo's port can be changed in conf/server.xml.
